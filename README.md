# Book-Search-Engine

## Description

Book-Search-Engine is an application powered by google's search engine that allows users to search for books. Users can search for books by entering 
in key words. The return of data consists of book titles, authors, and descriptions of the book along with an image. Users are allowed to sign-up to create
their own profiles and login after logging out. Users can also save selected books they like to their own profile but unfortunately this function of the website is unfinished 
and still in progress.
